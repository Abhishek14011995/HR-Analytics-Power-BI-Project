Excited to announce my successful completion of one of project using Power BI.

This challenge is an authentic real-time test posed by the HR department at AtliQ Technologies.

Objective :- To develop a Data Analytics Dashboard utilizing Power BI to extract valuable insights, uncover trends and patterns, facilitate business decision-making, and promote employee well-being.

Requirements of HR:-

1.Employee preferences regarding the choice between working remotely from home and working in the office. 2.Monitoring employee wellness by calculating the percentage of overall sick leave taken. 3.Identifying the reasons for the frequent selection of remote work options. 4.Identifying the maximum attendance percentage to facilitate event planning.

About The Dashboard:-

The dashboard offers insights into employee presence, work from home arrangements, and sick leave within AtliQ Technologies. It was designed to meet HR's specified requirements and involves analysis across multiple parameters to provide comprehensive insights.

The following key performance indicators (KPIs) have been formulated using DAX & MEASURES:

Attendance Rate Remote Work Rate Absenteeism Rate Total Attendance Days Remote Work Days Count Sick Leave Days Count

Benefits:- 1.With these data-driven insights, she can organize team-building activities or team lunches accordingly. 2.Another advantage of obtaining these insights is the ability to enhance capacity planning, particularly relevant if the company adopts a Hybrid Model such as working from home for two days and working from the office for three days. 3.Additionally, by leveraging such insights, the company can optimize space utilization and realize cost savings on infrastructure.
